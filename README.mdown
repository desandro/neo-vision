Neo-vision Chrome extension - syntax highlighted view-source 
============================================================

Syntax-highlights source code files, like Neo scoping out the Matrix (played by the infallible **Keanu Reeves**).  This one is better than all the others because...

+ Relies on [Google Code Prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) for quick and simple syntax highlighting
+ Highlight styles can be easily set in the options with basic CSS.
+ No beautifier/uncompressor included. Whitespace is preserved.

Currently only supports `.js` and `.css` files, but more extensions can be added as needed.
